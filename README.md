# Stima-Fifteen-Puzzle
Program to find the solution of a 15-puzzle. There are 3 methods which can be chosen:<br>
- Branch and Bound using incorrectly placed tile count
- Branch and Bound using manhattan distance
- My own method, the solution is not always optimal, but it always gives fast result

## Requirement
This program require:
- JDK 8 to build/compile
- JRE 8 to run the program in the bin folder<br>
<!-- -->
This program use Java Swing for the GUI, therefore some version of Java may not support it

## How to Compile
Make sure you have installed the Requirement. You can use Eclipse IDE to open the project and press the run button. Or you if you prefer a primitive method, you can javac *.java in the src folder

## How to Use
- Run using Eclipse IDE or execute java Main.class command from command line in the bin folder
- Select file source and method
- Wait until the calculation is finished
- The result (node count, execution time, etc.) will be printed and a new GUI Window will show tile movement animation of the solution
